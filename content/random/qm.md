Can you read plain simple English? Good, this is all you gonna need for this. Give me 6 minutes, I'll explain to you why it's not quantum mechanics that is scary, but a block of *cheese*. Use this knowledge to impress your crush or something. <br> <br>

First of all, don't be intimidated. It's not rocket science, only quantum mechanics. Look, you avoided physics in highschool? Perfect. You don't have an intuition for maths? Hell yeah. This is a safe place, I won't let any scary greek symbols or bra-kets hurt you.  <br> <br>

This is actually the best thing about writing/reading an intro to quantum mechanics: *for now*, nothing matters. <br> <br>

Quantum mechanics is counterintuitive, so not having a newtonian intuition at all might actually come in handy. (This is a blatant lie and only holds true for this intro.) So put on your lab coat and some glasses to look smart and let's dive straight in 🐌

>Disclaimer: this is an intro for non-STEM people who actually have a social life. I won't touch on any math or physics. <br> 
>If you recognise the real quantum mechanical concepts from my metaphors - how about you go touch some grass, buddy? (Just kidding, I'm proud of you surviving your thermodynamics exam)

Like any good old physics introduction, we start with something every well-practised enjoyer of science loves to play around with: balls. <br> <br>


Let's not stop here, let's be fancy and have different kind of balls. They shall be either hard or squishy & either black or white. Let's not stop here either. Remember? Nothing matters, we can do anything we want. So lets bring along some magical measurement boxes. <br> <br>

These magical boxes can distinguish between different kind of balls. How do they work? Eh, doesn't matter. If you want, just imagine your professor sitting in a box. We throw a ball at him, he looks at one attribute at a time, and sorts it. He might not be happy doing that, but he does an excellent job at sorting the balls by its attributes (he’s a professor, after all). <br> <br>

For the sake of keeping this blog short, our the professor did some prep work on his own and has determined that our ball attributes are independent of each other. This means: it doesn't matter if the ball is squishy or hard, it's gonna be randomly black or white either way. <br> <br>

Here are your two key takeaways:
1. we can filter and sort a batch of balls by measuring one of its two attributes (hard/squishy and black/white) 
2. the attributes are not dependent on each other (filtering by one attribute gives a random distribution for the other)

==Now this is where the fun starts.== What if we:

> 1) ask our Prof to sort the fancy balls by its colour first (black / white)
> 2) take *only the black balls* and let our Prof sort it again by its complexity (hard / squishy)
> 3) from this batch, *only take the hard ones*
> 4) using this batch of hard balls, ask our Prof again to sort it by its colour

**What do you think, what percentage in our final batch of hard balls will be black?** <br> <br>

Since you are a smart and logical individual who hasn’t been doing too much drugs and therefore possesses a healthy prefrontal cortex, you will hopefully grin at this task and wonder why this awfully ballsy introduction to quantum mechanics is so *easy*. <br><br>

So here's our prediction: **since we already filtered out all white balls at first, only black balls got through in the first place. So of course 100% of the balls after the hard/squishy sorting will be black, since no white ball ever arrived at the hard/squishy sorting!**<br> <br>

Pahahahh how easy, right? Look, I'm joining your superior mental scoff at this ridiculous simple question. <br> 
**EXCEPT IT'S WRONG**. Our thought experiment was the simplification of real quantum experiments, which were already done countless times by smart and probabaly important people. They produced the same puzzling results that still haunts me till today: <br> <br>

==The balls that were 100% black before hard/squishy sorting now consists of 50% white balls and 50% black balls after the hard/squishy sorting.== <br> <br>

Let me emphasise again. All scientific experiments precisely produced one single verified result. Every. Single. Time. The observations are absolute. The balls have seemingly lost and reset their attributes. What the fuck is going on?
<br>

Welcome to quantum mechanics, baby! Where the sole act of *knowing* about one attribute leads losing precise knowledge about another attribute. Come again? <br> <br>

This means for example: you can **never** know both position and velocity of any small object (like an electron) at one given time. Right... who cares? Does it matter? Well, a little bit. These small objects turn out to be the building blocks for everything and anything that is our existence. Oops. <br> <br> 

Getting better knowledge of their behaviour is what made our technological advances possible in the first place. Every single invention until now was fuelled by this knowledge, and every single invention to come will be as well. <br> <br>

So you tell me. Does it matter when humanity suddenly discovers that knowing both precise position and velocity at a given time is literally banned by god? Yeah. Now you know why physics people were freaking out when this shit was slowly confirmed. <br> <br>

Maybe you're still unimpressed. Size matters, after all. Who cares about the behaviour of small things. Your block of cheese you wanna place next to your avocado toast isn't going to enter superposition and *stop existing while existing*. Everything is fine, cheese will never just change its attributes because you were staring at it weirdly. Right? <br> <br> 

You'd be correct, although not entirely to be precise. There's a 20kg pendulum exercising this exact quantum behaviour inside a building at MIT. So your block of cheese technically *could* change its attributes because of your stalking gaze, and it's fascinating that it's actually **not**. <br> <br>

Let me paraphrase MIT physics Prof. Adams, who was also my inspiration to write this blog: 

>For us, it is the behaviour of big objects that seem intuitive and therefore correct, while in reality it is the behaviour of smaller elements that dictates a fundamental truth.

>The odd thing is not the weird behaviour of a single electron, but the miracle that taking 10^27 of them makes them behave like normal god damn cheese! (Hence the title of this chapter)

I hope I was able to present a somewhat interesting yet simple representation for non-stem people on what makes quantum mechanics so special. Keep in mind that the metaphors are hyperboles, macroscopic objects don't exhibit quantum behaviour for probabilistic reasons. Tha block of cheese you threw at me in retaliation of this cheesy metaphor *could* indeed hit an alien on mars instead, but the probablility is basically zero since it's not a quantum object.
