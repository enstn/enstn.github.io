<span class="text-highlight-bold">console.log() is the goat</span> <br> <br>

Here's a fancy term for non-coders reading this: debugging. You copy-pasted / wrote some code but it doesn't work as intented?
You don't know which part of the code? Well console.log() is here to save the day. <br> <br>

-> go to suspicious code portions; put console.log after critical returns or function calls; deploy & check the web
console for whether the print statement is reached or not; this will give you a scope of what's working and what not.
