<span class="text-highlight-bold>smash the console.log() function</span> <br> <br>

Here's a fancy term for non-coders reading this: debugging. You copy-pasted some code from ClaudeAI but it doesn't work?
You have already searched up the error on reddit, stackoverflow and ChatGPT, but have found nothing?
You don't know why? Well console.log() is here to save the day. <br> <br>

How to debug -> Go to the code portion you suspect is not working. Put a console.log after critical returns or function calls, deploy & check the web
console for whether the print statement is reached or not.
