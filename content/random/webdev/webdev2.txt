<span class="text-highlight-bold">LLMs are your biggest friends and enemies</span> <br> <br>

First of all, if you're gonna use LLMs - please don't use ChatGPT. As someone who is geniunely a noob in coding,
even I am able to confidently say that ChatGPT sucks at coding (as of Nov 27th 2024). Go for ClaudeAI. <br> <br> 

Second, be careful with LLM usage. They take away the process of thrifting through different internet sites and reading endless documentations
to piece together a solution. I admit, that's a great way to jumpstart your project (especially for non-coders). Overusage will 
catch up to you once your project becomes bigger and more complex though. LLMs are not good enough yet to zero-shot coding problems, so you'll be forced to
debug a codebase which you don't understand. (So you'll have to read the docs nonetheless, get scammed lol) <br> <br>

How to leverage LLMs (non-coders) -> ClaudeAI for coding, ChatGPT for explaining. <br> <br>

How to leverage LLms (coders) -> Abuse LLM as teacher: "Never return full code & play a role of an instructor. Help me diagnose the problem at hand & guide 
me towards learning the most efficient solution approaches." Understand problem first. Then reddit, stackoverflow and thinking about possible solutions. 
Try to implement the code snippets. Or bias LLM toward solution, then play around, modify & rewrite the LLM code to get a feeling.
