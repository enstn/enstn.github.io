<span class="text-highlight-bold">linking squarespace custom domain to github pages</span> <br> <br>

-> Here's a step by step: <br> <br>

1) make sure your repo is already deployed to github pages (read the first takeaway) <br> <br>
2) in terminal, run {dig yourusername.github.io} to get IP addresses <br> <br>
3) use them to set up four custom DNS settings in squarespace like this: <br>
Host: @ | Type: A | Data: insertyourIPaddresses <br> <br>
4) add the final custom record for CNAME: <br>
Host: www | Type: CNAME | Data: yourusername.github.io <br> <br>
5) delete the default DNS setting so only your custom settings are left <br> <br>
5) in github, create a CNAME file in root dir of your publishing branch + write your domain name into it <br> <br>
6) in github repo settings, go to pages and check whether custom domain has recognised CNAME file or not <br> <br>
7.1) if yes, click on check DNS and wait, this might take a while (24 hours for me) <br> <br>
7.2) if no, manually type in your domain name and click DNS check <br> !make sure it's the same as written in your CNAME file! <br> <br>
8) after success, click force enable https; you should be able to see your code deployed on your custom domain üêå
