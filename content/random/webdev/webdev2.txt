<span class="text-highlight-bold">LLMs are your biggest friends and enemies</span> <br> <br>

If you're gonna use LLMs - please don't use ChatGPT. As someone who is geniunely a beginner in coding,
even I am able to confidently say that ChatGPT sucks at coding (as of Nov 27th 2024). Go for ClaudeAI. <br> <br> 

Be careful with LLM usage. They take away the process of thrifting through different internet sites and reading endless documentations
to piece together a solution. 

<br> <br> Admittedly, that's a great way to jumpstart your project (especially for non-coders). But in the long-term, overusage will 
catch up to you once your project becomes bigger and more complex. I experienced it myself.

<br> <br> LLMs are not good enough yet to zero-shot coding problems, so you'll be forced to
debug a codebase which you don't understand. (So you'll have to read the docs nonetheless, get scammed lol) <br> <br>

-> non-coders: ClaudeAI for coding, ChatGPT for explaining; pray and hope for errorless code<br> <br>

-> beginner-coders: leverage LLM as teacher: "Never return full code & play a role of an instructor. Help me diagnose the problem at hand & guide 
me towards learning the most efficient solution approaches." <br> <br>
