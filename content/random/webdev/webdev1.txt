Basic ass advice, I know, I know. But it has to be said. Minimalistic website building has become easy peasy üçã squeezy nowadays. 
And by easy, I mean easy af. You geniunely don't even have to know coding to build a website. Build with god damn LLMs, it doesn't matter.
What matters is you start creating something, anything really. <br> <br>

How to get started: -> Go to github.com, create an account, create a repo called <yourusername>.github.io. Crate an index.html file. Deploy your repo 
using githubpages (just read the doc). Then use stackoverflow, reddit, github, ChatGPT, ClaudeAI or whatever to write a hello world text in your
html.file. <br> <br>
 
Boom. You now have a working website with https security where you can build anything you want.
