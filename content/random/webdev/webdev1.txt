<span class="text-highlight-bold">Just start you unicell.</span> <br> <br>

Basic ahh advice, but it has to be said. Minimalistic website building has become easy peasy üçã squeezy nowadays. 

<br> <br>
You geniunely don't even have to know coding to build a website. Build with god damn LLMs, it doesn't matter.
What matters is you start creating something, anything really. <br> <br>

-> Go to github.com; create an account; create a repo called <yourusername>.github.io; make an index.html file; deploy your repo 
using githubpages (just read the doc); then use stackoverflow, reddit, github, ChatGPT, ClaudeAI or whatever to write a hello world text in your
html.file. <br> <br>
