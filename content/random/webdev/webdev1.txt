<span class="text-highlight-bold">how to start</span> <br> <br>

Use githubpages. It's free, you can write code, deploy your website and link to a custom domain. <br> <br>

-> Go to github.com; create an account; create a repo called <yourusername>.github.io; make an index.html file; deploy your repo 
using githubpages (just read the doc); then use stackoverflow, reddit, github, ChatGPT, ClaudeAI or whatever to write a hello world text in your
html.file. <br> <br>
 
If you're an ETH student thinking about using your given ETH domain - I recommend not to (except for TAs). I started 
there as well and have now switched to githubpages. Several reasons: <br> <br>

1) ETH domains "only" have PHP and CGI (more than enough for static websites)  <br> 
2) You need to ssh and login with cisco connect every time <br>
3) ETH servers down = you can't code, which happens more often than you think  <br> 
4) If you use vscode, you need to delete .vscode-server with a terminal ssh session before every vscode session (bc ETH servers have permission issues with VScode ssh extenstion)
