<span class="text-highlight-bold">setting up squarespace custom domain for github pages</span> <br> <br>

Here's a step by step: <br> <br>

1) make sure your repo is already deployed to github pages <br> <br>
2) in terminal, run $dig yourusername.github.io to get IP addresses <br> <br>
3) use the numbers and set up four custom DNS settings in squarespace like this: <br>
Host: @ | Type: A | Data: insertyourIPaddresses <br> <br>
4) add the final custom record for CNAME: <br>
Host: www | Type: CNAME | Data: yourusername.github.io <br> <br>
5) in github, create a CNAME file in root dir of your publishing branch with your domain name in it <br> <br>
6) in github repo settings, go to pages and check whether custom domain has found CNAME file or not <br> <br>
7) click on check DNS and wait, this might take a while (24 hours for me) <br> <br>
8) after success, click force enable https; you should be able to see your code deployed on your custom domain! <br> <br>
