<span class="text-highlight-bold">squarespace custom domain for github pages</span> <br> <br>

Here's a step by step: <br> <br>

1) make sure your repo is already deployed to github pages <br> <br>
2) in terminal, run $dig <yourusername>.github.io to get IP addresses <br> <br>
3) use the numbers and set up four custom DNS settings in squarespace like this: <br>
Host: @ | Type: A | Data: <IP address> <br> <br>
4) add the final custom record with your CNAME: <br>
Host: www | Type: CNAME | Data: <yourusername>.github.io <br> <br>
5) in github, create a CNAME file in root dir of your publishing branch with your domain name in it
6) in github repo settings, go to pages and check whether custom domain has found CNAME file or not
7) click on check DNS and wait, this might take a while (24 hours for me)
8) after success, click force enable https and you're done.
