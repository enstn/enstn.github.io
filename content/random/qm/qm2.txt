What do you think, what percentage in our final batch of hard balls will be black? <br> <br>

Since you are a smart and logical individual who hasnâ€™t been doing too much drugs and therefore possesses a healthy prefrontal cortex, 
you will hopefully grin at this task and wonder why this awfully ballsy introduction to quantum mechanics is so 
<span class="italic">easy</span>. <br> <br>

So here's our prediction: <span class="text-italic">since we already filtered out all white balls at first, only black balls got through in the first place. 
So of course 100% of the balls after the hard/squishy sorting will be black, since no white ball ever arrived at the hard/squishy sorting!</span>
<br> <br>

PAHAHAHH how easy, right? Look, I'm joining your superior smirking at this ridiculous simple question. <br> 
EXCEPT IT'S WRONG. Our thought experiment was the simplification of real quantum experiments, which were already done
countless times by smart and probabaly important people. They produced the same puzzling results that still haunts me till today. <br> <br>

Let me emphasise again. They all precisely produced one single verified result. Every. Single. Time. The observations
are absolute: <span class="text-highlight">the balls that were 100% black before hard/squishy sorting now consists of 50% white balls and 50% black balls after the hard/squishy sorting. </span> <br> <br>

The balls have seemingly lost and reset their attributes! What the fuck is going on?
