I hope I was able to present a somewhat interesting yet simple representation for non-stem people on what makes quantum mechanics so special. 
Keep in mind that the metaphors are hyperboles, macroscopic objects don't exhibit quantum behaviour for probabilistic reasons. Tha block of cheese 
you threw at me in retaliation of this cheesy metaphor <span class="text-italic">could</span> indeed hit an alien on mars instead, but the probablility
is basically zero since it's not a quantum object.
