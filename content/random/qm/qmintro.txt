Can you read plain simple English? Good, this is all you gonna need for this. Give me 6 minutes, I'll explain what makes
quantum mechanics quantum mechanics so you can impress your crush or whatever next time. <br> <br>

Disclaimer: this is an intro for non-STEM people who actually have a social life. I won't touch on any math or physics. 
If you recognise the real quantum mechanical concepts from my metaphors - how about you go touch some grass, buddy? (Just kidding,
I'm proud of you surviving your thermodynamics exam.) <br> <br>

Now, back to quantum mechanics. Don't be scared, it's not rocket science. Look, you avoided physics in highschool? Perfect. 
You don't have an intuition for maths? Hell yeah, even better! This is a safe place, I won't let any scary greek symbol hurt you.  <br> <br>

To be honest, this is the best thing about writing / reading an intro to quantum mechanics: <span class="text-italic">for now, nothing matters</span>. <br> <br>

Quantum mechanics is counterintuitive, so not having a newtonian intuition at all actually comes in handy. So put on your lab coat and 
some glasses to look smart and let's dive straight in: <br> <br>
