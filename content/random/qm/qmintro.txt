Can you read plain simple English? Good, this is all you gonna need for this. Give me 6 minutes, I'll explain to you 
why it's not quantum mechanics that is scary, but a block of <span class="text-italic">cheese</span>. 
Use this knowledge to impress your crush or something. <br> <br>

First of all, don't be intimidated. It's not rocket science, only quantum mechanics. Look, you avoided physics in highschool? Perfect. 
You don't have an intuition for maths? Hell yeah. This is a safe place, I won't let any scary greek symbols or bra-kets hurt you.  <br> <br>

This is actually the best thing about writing/reading an intro to quantum mechanics: 
<span class="text-italic">for now, nothing matters</span>. <br> <br>

Quantum mechanics is counterintuitive, so not having a newtonian intuition at all might actually come in handy. (This is a
blatant lie and only holds true for this intro.) So put on your lab coat and 
some glasses to look smart and let's dive straight in üêå
