Disclaimer: this is an intro for non-STEM people who actually have a social life. I won't touch on any math or physics. 
If you recognise the real quantum mechanical concepts from my metaphors - how about you go touch some grass, buddy? (Just kidding,
I'm proud of you surviving your thermodynamics exam)
