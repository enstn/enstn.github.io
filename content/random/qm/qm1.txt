Like any good old physics introduction, we start with something every well-practised enjoyer of science loves to play around with: balls. <br> <br>

Let's not stop here, let's be fancy and have different kind of balls. They shall be either hard or squishy & either black or white. 
Let's not stop here either. Remember? Nothing matters, we can do anything we want. So lets bring along some magical measurement boxes. <br> <br>

These magical boxes can distinguish between different kind of balls. How do they work? Eh, doesn't matter. If you want,
just imagine your professor sitting in a box. We throw a ball at him, he looks at one attribute at a time, and sorts it. 
He might not be happy doing that, but he does an excellent job at sorting the balls by its attributes (heâ€™s a professor, after all). <br> <br>

For the sake of keeping this blog short, our the professor did some prep work on his own and has determined that our ball attributes
are independent of each other. This means: it doesn't matter if the ball is squishy or hard, it's gonna be randomly black or white either way. <br> <br>

Here are your two takeaways: <br>
1): we can filter and sort a batch of balls by measuring one of its two attributes (hard/squishy and black/white) <br>
2): the attributes are not dependent on each other (filtering by one attribute gives a random distribution for the other) <br>
