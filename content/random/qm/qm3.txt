Welcome to quantum mechanics, baby! Where the sole act of knowing about one attribute leads to you losing precise knowledge about the other attribute.
Come again? <br> <br>

This means you can never know both position and velocity of any small object (like an electron) at a given time. Right... who cares? Does it matter?
Well, a little bit. These small objects turn out to be the building blocks for everything and anything that is our existence. Oops. <br> <br> 

Getting better knowledge of their behaviour is what made our technological advances possible in the first place. 
Every single inventions by human kind was - and every single invention to come will be - fuelled by this knowledge. <br> <br>

So you tell me. Does it matter when we suddenly find out that knowing both precist position and velocity at a given time is literally banned by god?
Yeah, that's why physics people were freaking out when this shit was discovered. <br> <br>

Maybe you're still unimpressed. Size matters, after all. Who care about the behaviour of small things. Your block of cheese you wanna put beside your
avocado toast isn't going to <span class="text-italic"> stop existing while existing </span>. Everything is fine 
since cheese will never just change its attributes because you were staring at it weirdly! <br> <br> 

Well, jokes on you. There's a 20kg big ass pendulum exercising this exact quantum behaviour inside the MIT building. 
So yeah, your block of cheese could technically change its attributes because of your stalking gaze, and it is actually fascinating that it's  
<span class="text-italic">not</span>. <br> <br>

Let me paraphrase MIT physics Prof. Adams, who was also my inspiration to write this blog:
