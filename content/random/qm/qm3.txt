Welcome to quantum mechanics, baby! Where the sole act of <span class="text-italic">knowing</span> about one attribute leads losing precise knowledge 
about the other attribute. Come again? <br> <br>

This means for example: you can <span class="text-bold">never</span> know both position and velocity of any small object (like an electron) 
at one given time. Right... who cares? Does it matter? Well, a little bit. These small objects turn out to be the building blocks for everything and 
anything that is our existence. Oops. <br> <br> 

Getting better knowledge of their behaviour is what made our technological advances possible in the first place. 
Every single invention until now was fuelled by this knowledge, and every single invention to come will be as well. <br> <br>

So you tell me. Does it matter when humanity suddenly discovers that knowing both precise position and velocity at a given time is literally banned by god?
Yeah. Now you know why physics people were freaking out when this shit was slowly confirmed. <br> <br>

Maybe you're still unimpressed. Size matters, after all. Who care about the behaviour of small things. Your block of cheese you wanna place next to your
avocado toast isn't going to enter superposition and <span class="text-italic"> stop existing while existing </span>. Everything is fine,
cheese will never just change its attributes because you were staring at it weirdly. Right? <br> <br> 

You'd be correct, although not entirely to be precise. There's a 20kg big ass pendulum exercising this exact quantum behaviour inside a building at MIT. 
So your block of cheese technically could change its attributes because of your stalking gaze, and it's fascinating that it's actually
<span class="text-italic">not</span>. <br> <br>

Let me paraphrase MIT physics Prof. Adams, who was also my inspiration to write this blog:
