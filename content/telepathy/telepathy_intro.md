> Imagine typing "Hello World". Not with your fingers, but by *imagining* the letters.

The idea is simple: recognise which letter the user is thinking about by analysing its brain activity in real time using electro-encephalography. I agree, it's far from actual mind-reading, but I do believe it's a promising step towards man-made telepathy without a magical wand.<br><br> 

Now, as one of my friends so elegantly put it: *Why the fuck would anyone want that?* <br><br> 

She's right. Thought-invasive technology isn't just any double edged sword; it's **the** sword of Damocles with our literal freedom of will cowering under it. So yeah, why *would* anyone want this? <br><br>

The target audience (as of now) isn't you, or me. It's people who lost their muscle control yet still exists with a healthy brain. They're conscious about the world but can't physically interact with it or their loved ones. Can you imagine how insufferable this must be? Brain-computer interfaces can restore the ability of interaction with the outer world. <br> <br>

To keep the moral debate short, I believe technology shouldn't be solely judged by its future promises (both good and bad), but primarily by its current use. And as of now, the 9th December of 2024, brain-computer-interfaces are ==giving patients their freedom and autonomy back==, rather than restricting them. That's why I started pursuing this project. [D√ºrrenmatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physicists) would probably get a seizure if he read this paragraph. <br><br>

So how can we recognise brain signals & accurately map them to letters? Well, we don't possess black magic vodoo abilities, but living in the 21st century grants us access to a magical black box called ‚ú®*neural networks* ‚ú® <br><br>

People with tech background probabaly saw this coming from a mile away. In it's core, imagined speech recognition is a multiclass classification problem, a well-known problem in machine learning. <br><br>

Indeed, we collect brain data with test-patients thinking about a specific letter, manually label it & use the labeled data to train a neural net. For people with no machine learning knowledge: we're just finding a function with takes the brain signals as input & returns a single number between 0 and 25 as output (which can be mapped to a letter).<br><br> 

Yes, you understood me correctly. Applied telepathy is just glorified math-function approximation. No, I don't understand the entire math behind it. I'm just a monkey who throws shitty self-recorded data, compute and "educated" guesses at the problem until it somehow works üßëüèª‚Äçü¶Ø‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è üï≥Ô∏è <br><br>

If you still don't understand what in the geek is going on: we basically create a dictionary where you can look up and match brain-signal-patterns to single letters. The goal is to make our dictionary non-shitty and highly accurate. <br><br>

And so, we begin. Let's imagine letters, wield the power of machine learning tomfoolery, and see just how close we can get to breaking the barriers between mind and machine. <br> <br>
